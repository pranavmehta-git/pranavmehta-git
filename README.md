Hi, I'm Pranav Mehta

I’m an MPA student at Columbia SIPA focusing on data-driven policy, financial systems, and how real-world institutions actually work. I use R, Python, and Tableau to turn messy public data into clear, reproducible insights.

Before SIPA, I worked on CBDCs, Open Finance, and digital policy at the Central Bank of the UAE, where I learned that systems look orderly from afar and delightfully chaotic up close.

I also write: sometimes analysis, sometimes humor—often about institutions, technology, and the strange choreography of people inside them. At Columbia, I write Diplomessy, a column about everyday diplomacy in academic life.

Outside policy and code: I run, read history, obsess over good dashboards, and occasionally climb mountains with spotty phone service.

If you want to talk about data, digital policy, AI governance, or why R Markdown is superior to Google Docs, I’m always happy to chat!
